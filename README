REQUIREMENTS
------------

The project assumes a reasonably-standard Linux environment, available C
compiler, CMake, and at least Python 2.6, along with a variety of supporting
modules. Using virtualenv is strongly recommended. The core dependencies are
listed in the `MODULES` file, which can be passed as a requirements file to the
pip package management tool with `pip install -r MODULES`.

COMPILATION
-----------

# Overview

Most of the project is written in Python, but important subsets are written in
Cython and compiled. CMake is used to handle compilation and installation. The
procedure roughly follows:

1. create an out-of-source build directory, eg, `mkdir build`
2. run cmake from the build directory, eg:

`cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix> <path_to_source_tree>`

3. `make`
4. `make install`

# Dependencies

To provide the location of libraries in nonstandard installation prefixes to
cmake, define `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`; eg, if required libraries are installed under
`/opt/foo/include` and `/opt/foo/lib`:

`cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/foo <other_options>`

Note that CMake has known issues with paths that include colons.
